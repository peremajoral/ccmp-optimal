# Fix CI Epic Progress

## Analysis Complete âœ…

**Problem Identified**: CI workflow configured for Node.js project but codebase is shell script-based CCPM system.

**Root Issues**:
1. Missing package.json and Node.js scripts expected by GitHub Actions
2. No appropriate linting/testing for shell scripts
3. CI workflow incompatible with actual project technology

**Impact**: All CI jobs failing, auto-merge blocked, development workflow broken

## Solution Approach

Replace Node.js-based CI with shell script-appropriate quality gates:
- Shellcheck for linting
- Bats for shell script testing
- Shell-based build validation
- Maintain same multi-level quality gate structure

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Root cause analysis
- [ ] Create shell-based CI scripts
- [ ] Replace GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Test CI pipeline
- [ ] Verify auto-merge functionality

## Next Steps

1. Implement .claude/scripts/ci/ scripts for lint/test/build
2. Update .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml for shell project
3. Test with actual commit to verify fixes
